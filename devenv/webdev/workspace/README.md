# Web Development Projects

This directory is mounted inside the container as `/home/bigsky033/workspace`. All your web development projects should be created in this directory.

## Projects

- `test-app/` - A simple Node.js Express application to test the development environment

## Getting Started

To start a new project, navigate to this directory inside the container and use your preferred framework:

```bash
# React project
create-react-app my-project

# Vite project
npm create vite@latest my-project
```

## Project Structure

Each project should have its own subdirectory with a proper `.gitignore` file for the project's dependencies and build artifacts.
